= General Slim

A slimmed down version of general intended to operate at a small scale, similar to Advance Wars, aimed at testing out some of the ideas I have for a larger scale version of this game. The intention is to build effectively a limited Advance wars-system clone, and then evolve some of the ideas. Expected features of the clone product are as follows, with differences from advance wars in italics

* A small grid/tile based map
* Multiple unit types with movement rates and attack characteristics
* Terrain types affecting movement
* Direct orders
* No command structure
* Turn based
* Fog of war
* AI enemy commander
* Roads, rivers, cities
* _No base building_
* _No air or sea_

== Iteration goals

* Moveable units
* Combat
* Terrain
* AI

=== Iteration 1: A map with movable units

* A small ~10x10 map with no terrain features
* Two opposing forces of two infantry units each
* Units can be issued orders to move 3 squares
* No AI, player plays both sides
* End turn

== Iteration 2: Combat

* Units can attack one another, reducing HP
* Units are destroyed and removed from the map when their HP reaches zero 
* A second, Cavalry unit type is added with different characteristics

== Iteration 3: Terrain and features

* Map has roads, and units have increased range on roads
* Map has forests, with increased defence and lower movement rate
* Map has mountains, impassible by cavalry
