= General Slim

A slimmed down version of general intended to operate at a small scale, similar to Advance Wars, aimed at testing out some of the ideas I have for a larger scale version of this game. The intention is to build effectively a limited Advance wars-system clone, and then evolve some of the ideas. Expected features of the clone product are as follows, with differences from advance wars in italics

* A small grid/tile based map
* Multiple unit types with movement rates and attack characteristics
* Terrain types affecting movement
* Direct orders
* No command structure
* Turn based
* Fog of war
* AI enemy commander
* Roads, rivers, cities
* _No base building_
* _No air or sea_

== Iteration goals

* Moveable units
* Combat
* Terrain
* AI

=== Iteration 1: A map with movable units

* DONE A small ~10x10 map with no terrain features 
* DONE Two opposing forces of two infantry units each  
* DONE Units can be issued orders to move 1 square  
* DONE No AI, player plays both sides  
* DONE End turn on "c"  
* DONE UI for displaying field and issuing orders  
* DONE Cursor  
* DONE Select units  
* DONE cursor doesn't go OOB  
* DONE error handling for movement~
* DONE Highlight moveable area  

* DONE Opacity for select  
* DONE Iteration 1a: units can't move twice in a turn  
* DONE ending turn refreshes sides move-points  
* DONE Iteration 1b: box display of cursor coord, whose turn  
* DONE Status box moves if cursor is over it  

== Iteration 2: Combat

* DONE units have HP  
* DONE Units name and HP displayed in status box  
* DONE Units are destroyed and removed from the map when their HP reaches zero  
* DONE Units can attack one another  
* DONE Units have attack and defense power, which impacts the HP they lose in combat  
* DONE Attack power depends on strength  

* DONE Unit identfiers on tile  
* DONE A second, Cavalry unit type is added  
* DONE Cavalry can move 2 spaces  
* DONE move points refesh from max move points  
* DONE highlight shows manhattan distance based on move points 
* DONE Fix routing so you can't do that loop thing   Hacked!
* DONE can move 2 squares at once  
* DONE Cavalry have different attack characteristics  
* DONE Attack/Def chars in menu  

== Iteration 3: Terrain and features

* DONE Map has forests
* DONE and lower movement rate
* DONE Display HP on unit tile, get rid of status box
* DONE Debug box
* DONE Have moving into forests decrease movement rate accordingly
* DONE Top left turn indicator
* DONE increased defence 
* DONE Map has mountains, impassible by cavalry
* DONE Map has roads, and units have increased range on roads
* DONE Roads draw based on direction properly
* DONE forked roads and crossroads
* DONE (but broke attacking) Fix units moving though other units
* DONE Fix attack / Attack after move
** DONE AW style wait menu after move
** DONE add attack option if enemy unit in adjacent

* DONE variable size levels

* Bug: unit is still selected when finished move and no attack option
* Bug: units can't _not_ move and then attack
* Bug?: units can complete eliminate eachother in combat

* Cursor to target on attack
* Battle predictor, AW style
* In battles, attackers losses are modified by the terrain they're on. AW shows 
** terrain+def
** target hp, supplies, fuel
** damage %
* Bug: in battle, attackers losses are not impacted by defenders hp

* REPLICATE FIRST AW LEVEL

* Map builder stuff, level persistence
* Rivers
* Message display system (-> message, seconds to display)
* Only move once ('has moved')
* FOW
* AI
* Sprites
* Draw terrain on static layer
* Artillery

== Post MVP

* Commander skill
* Facing and flanking
* Supplies / Wagons
