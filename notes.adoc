= General Slim

A slimmed down version of general intended to operate at a small scale, similar to Advance Wars, aimed at testing out some of the ideas I have for a larger scale version of this game. The intention is to build effectively a limited Advance wars-system clone, and then evolve some of the ideas. Expected features of the clone product are as follows, with differences from advance wars in italics

* A small grid/tile based map
* Multiple unit types with movement rates and attack characteristics
* Terrain types affecting movement
* Direct orders
* No command structure
* Turn based
* Fog of war
* AI enemy commander
* Roads, rivers, cities
* _No base building_
* _No air or sea_
