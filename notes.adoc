= General Slim

A slimmed down version of general intended to operate at a small scale, similar to Advance Wars, aimed at testing out some of the ideas I have for a larger scale version of this game. The intention is to build effectively a limited Advance wars-system clone, and then evolve some of the ideas. Expected features of the clone product are as follows, with differences from advance wars in italics

* A small grid/tile based map
* Multiple unit types with movement rates and attack characteristics
* Terrain types affecting movement
* Direct orders
* No command structure
* Turn based
* Fog of war
* AI enemy commander
* Roads, rivers, cities
* _No base building_
* _No air or sea_

== DONE

* DONE Onscreen General
* DONE LOS increased on hills
* DONE Generate IDs, display names 
* DONE Short names to display on unit counters
* DONE proper algorithm for viewsheds
* DONE Bend roads properly
* DONE Improve road drawings: tiles depend on surrounding
* DONE Bug: If a general tries to attack, it throws (make it so a general doesn't have any attack options)
* DONE Set up proper dev/repl space

== DOING

=== Enemy Intel

* DONE Add individual viewsheds to units
* DONE Add turn number to ui
* Side has 'sightings'. Each sighting is an 
* When your unit loses sight of an enemy unit, an intel counter is created and placed at the location the enemy unit was last seen
* The sighting tracks how many turns ago since the sighting was made
* When that location comes into visibility again, the counter is replaced by the actual unit (even if they are not in the same location)
* Move intel counters: If displaying an intel card instead of a unit, A general should be able to move that intel card, changing his estimation of where the unit is

== TODO

=== Small

* retreat improve: a retreating unit should prefer to escape into forests or hills if they are available
* QOL: When turn ends, cursor is moved to the nearest unit (Camera moves too)

=== Medium

* Put in actual time, display in top right
* when in attack mode, menu should show the attributes of the two sides are
* Replace routing path with arrow, extend to attack with BANG! 
* Win condition: no enemy units
* Lose condition: no remaining units
* Infantry Charging
* Rivers
* enemy unit info - attack range on button hold
* Sprite for general
* Sprite for cav
* Sprite for art
* Refactor units to remove side as a top level key?

=== Large

==== Morale

* Units have morale score that causes them to route if they fail a roll during a battle. A routed unit disappers from the map.
* Unit morale recovers over time where they are not engaged
* Morale increases faster when units aren't moving
* Morale recovery is nil if the unit has no food
* Morale is damaged by not having food or ammunition

==== Reframe all actions in terms of time taken

* Decide on turn length and square size
* Each unit has a mph rating for each terrain type
* Movement radius' are defined in terms of that. So if movement rate on road is 3mph, a unit can move 1.5 miles in a turn
* Other actions can be framed in that, like formup time
* A units movement pool then gets framed in minutes remaining in a turn, and the actions they can perform are dependent on that.


==== Pre-battle stuff
==== Cavalry combat system
==== Artillery combat and indirect fire
==== Facing and flanking
==== Supplies / Wagons

* Units have supplies of food and ammunition
* Units have hunger, affects fighting and marching speed
* Units without ammunition have a big penalty
* Supply screen at edge of square
* Wagons made available each turn
* You can order wagons to units
* Wagons can be interdicted/captured by enemy

==== Message system

* Units can send messages to eachother
* Unit can send a combat report to their commander, reporting the result of an engagement
* Unit can send a status report to their commander, detailing the strength and condition of their unit
* Messengers take time to move between units (following map)
* Messengers are displayed on screen
* Messengers can be intercepted by enemy, meaning the message will never reach its destination

==== Unit Status: Forming up

* Additional menu option: Form up. A unit that isn't formed up is much less combat effective
* Indicate formed up on unit counter somehow
* A unit can unform, which puts them back in to movement status
* Forming up takes time, reduces action pool
* A unit's movement highlight has a distinguishing tint: white for where they can move and still form up and attack, red for where they can move, but will not be able to form up and attack afterwards
* Moving while formed up is possible, but much slower

==== Unit differentiation

* Units can have modifiers to hit rates
* Units can have modifiers to move speeds
* Units can have modifiers to morale recovery

==== Commanders

* Each regiment has a commander
* Commanders can be 'stubborn', and be less likely to order a retreat
* Commanders can be 'inspiring' and make their unit less likely to route in combat, but which means they are more likely to be killed in combat. A unit with no commander can't retreat and is much more likely to route
* Commanders can be 'caring', which improves morale recovery at the cost of movement rate
* Commanders can be 'taskmasters', which improves movement rate but reduces morale recovery

=== Huge

==== Enemy AI

==== Rework order system to be more indirect

* General can order units to move to any location on the map
* General can provide general orders:
** Attack any enemy in the vicinity
** Hold the location
** Report on enemy movements but avoid combat
* Unit will be responsible for creating and execting its own order on each turn

=== Maybes

* Friendly FOW
* Variable FOV: units that come into LOS within 3 distance are directly in sight. Units that come into LOS within 4 distance generate a sighting, but are not directly visible
* Chance of a false sighting
* Unit status: Dugin / Encamped
* Unit status: Organizing
